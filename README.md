# HuggingFace-GenAI
In this project I use different libraries/models from hugging face ranging from sentiment analysis, to summarization to chatbots.

Hugging face offers alot of Open source libraries for the public to use and its alot more easier to use pretrained models of those sizes than to do it yourself as it is costly.
In this project the main focus is Transformers.

1. Initialize a Python Environment
2. After which, activate the environment
3. Then you install requirements.txt ( with command python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
) or in Conda hf-env.yml
